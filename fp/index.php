                <p>Wyatt was born and raised along the Front Range of Colorado, where he would eventually earn his Private Pilot’s certificate in 2009 at the age of 17.

                <p>In his 10 years as a pilot, Wyatt has enjoyed a variety of flight conditions from the windswept countryside of the Great Plains, to the challenging mountainous terrain of the Rocky Mountains. He continues to fly and train for his Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) certification in the Seattle area where he now lives. When he isn’t in a cockpit, you can find him enjoying the outdoors on a paddleboard or engaging other challengers on a variety of video games.</p>

He has accumulated time in the Cessna 152, 172 Skyhawk, 180 Skywagon, and 182 Skylane; as well as in the Piper PA28-R200 Arrow and the deHavilland DHC-2 Beaver.
