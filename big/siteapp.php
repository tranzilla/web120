<p>Your website is responsive and everything scales to size based on the device’s width. So why do you still need a mobile app? It all comes down to one element - user experience. According to Modolabs<sup>1</sup>, over 86 percent of users who spend their time on mobile devices spend their time on native mobile apps. While a responsive website ensures a good experience when browsing on small devices, users are demanding a curated experience exclusively for mobile devices. 
</p>
<p>When comparing a responsive website with a mobile application, there are many pros and cons to evaluate. Creating a responsive website is cost effective. It takes a much shorter amount of time and a lot less people are needed. However, the website will not have many functionality that are quick to use and the layout can vary depending on the browsers<sup>3</sup>. On a mobile app, functionality is the key objective therefore, it is custom built (usually from ground up) for each OS system (android, iOS, etc.)<sup>2</sup>. This requires more skills from a developer(back-end coding) and because of this, it takes longer to develop and cost more. 
</p>
<p>So how do you determine if a responsive website or a mobile app is right for you? A business first needs to have an online presence. In order to make it easier for users to navigate your website, it should be responsive on all platforms (desktop, tablet, and mobile) therefore, you should focus on creating a responsive website first. But if you already have that established and you want to branch out for better brand awareness, invest in a mobile application. In short, it really depend on what your business’s needs are.
