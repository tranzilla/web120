            <p>Hello, my name is Tran. I grew up in Colorado and after finishing my B.A. in Molecular Biology, I moved to Seattle. I love being near the water, trying new exciting food, and spending time with my adorable dog Autumn.</p>
            <p>I took my first coding class in 2017 and have been learning since then! I know HTML, CSS, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. Although I know a few programming languages, my favorite is Python! I'm hoping to become a software engineer, developing apps.</p>
            <p>In the realm of development, I'm best at writing logical codes(Python, PHP) and debugging (It's so satistifying to fix a bug!) but I am not good at the creative/artistic side(CSS).</p>
